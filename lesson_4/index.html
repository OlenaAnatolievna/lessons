            <h2>Info</h2>
            <p>
               <span>Ukraine</span> is a country in Eastern Europe. It is the second-largest European country after
               Russia, which it borders to the east and northeast. Ukraine covers approximately 600,000 square
               kilometres (230,000 sq mi). Prior to the ongoing Russian invasion, it was the eighth-most populous
               country in Europe, with a population of around 41 million people. It is also bordered by Belarus to the
               north; by Poland, Slovakia, and Hungary to the west; and by Romania and Moldova to the southwest; with a
               coastline along the Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to the south and southeast. Kyiv is the nation's
               capital and largest city. Ukraine's state language is Ukrainian; Russian is also widely spoken,
               especially in the east and south.

            <p>
               Mikhail Gorbachev pursued a policy of limited liberalization of public life, known as perestroika, and
               attempted to reform a stagnating economy. The latter failed, but the democratization of the Soviet Union
               fuelled nationalist and separatist tendencies among the ethnic minorities, including Ukrainians.
            </p>
            <p>
               As part of the so-called parade of sovereignties, on 16 July 1990, the newly elected Supreme Soviet of
               the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic adopted the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Ukraine; after a
               putsch of some Communist leaders in Moscow failed to depose Gorbachov, outright independence was
               proclaimed on 24 August 1991 and approved by 92% of the Ukrainian electorate in a referendum on 1
               December. Ukraine's new President, Leonid Kravchuk, went on to sign the Belavezha Accords and made
               Ukraine a founding member of the much looser Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), though Ukraine
               never became a full member of the latter as it did not ratify the agreement founding CIS. These documents
               sealed the fate of the Soviet Union, which formally voted itself out of existence on 26 December.

            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>
               The establishment of the state of Kievan Rus' remains obscure and uncertain. The state included much of
               present-day Ukraine, Belarus and the western part of European Russia. According to the Primary Chronicle,
               the Rus' people initially consisted of Varangians from Scandinavia. In 882, the pagan Prince Oleg (Oleh)
               conquered Kyiv from Askold and Dir and proclaimed it as the new capital of the Rus'. Anti-Normanist
               historians however argue that the East Slavic tribes along the southern parts of the Dnieper River were
               already in the process of forming a state independently. The Varangian elite, including the ruling Rurik
               dynasty, later assimilated into the Slavic population. Kievan Rus' was composed of several principalities
               ruled by the interrelated Rurikid kniazes ("princes"), who often fought each other for possession of
               Kyiv.
            </p>
            <p>
               During the 10th and 11th centuries, Kievan Rus' became the largest and most powerful state in Europe, a
               period known as its Golden Age. It began with the reign of Vladimir the Great (980–1015), who introduced
               Christianity. During the reign of his son, Yaroslav the Wise (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith
               of its cultural development and military power. The state soon fragmented as the relative importance of
               regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of Vladimir II Monomakh (1113–1125)
               and his son Mstislav (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities
               following Mstislav's death, though ownership of Kyiv would still carry great prestige for decades. In the
               11th and 12th centuries, the nomadic confederacy of the Turkic-speaking Cumans and Kipchaks was the
               dominant force in the Pontic steppe north of the Black Sea.
            </p>
            <p>
               The Mongol invasions in the mid-13th century devastated Kievan Rus' and Kyiv was completely destroyed in
               1240. In the western territories, the principalities of Halych and Volhynia had arisen earlier, and were
               merged together to form the Principality of Galicia–Volhynia. Daniel of Galicia, son of Roman the Great,
               re-united much of south-western Rus', including Volhynia, Galicia, as well as Kyiv. He was subsequently
               crowned by the papal archbishop as the first king of Galicia–Volhynia (also known as the Kingdom of
               Ruthenia) in 1253.

            <h2>War</h2>
            <p>
               On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine in a major escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War, which began
               in 2014. The invasion has caused tens of thousands of deaths on both sides and has instigated Europe's
               largest refugee crisis since World War II. About 8 million Ukrainians were displaced within their country
               by late May, and more than 7.9 million fled the country by 3 January 2023.
            </p>
            <p>
               The invasion began the morning of 24 February 2022 upon Russian president Vladimir Putin's announcement
               of a "special military operation" seeking the "demilitarisation" and "denazification" of Ukraine. In his
               address, Putin espoused irredentist views, challenged Ukraine's right to statehood, and falsely claimed
               that Ukraine was governed by neo-Nazis who persecuted the ethnic Russian minority. Minutes later, Russian
               air strikes and a ground invasion were launched along a northern front from Belarus towards Kyiv, a
               north-eastern front towards Kharkiv, a southern front from Crimea, and a south-eastern front from Donetsk
               and Luhansk. In response, Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy enacted martial law and a general
               mobilisation.
